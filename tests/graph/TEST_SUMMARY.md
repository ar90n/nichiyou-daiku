## Failed Tests Analysis

The 24 failing tests are for methods that haven't been implemented yet:
- `remove_lumber_piece()`
- `remove_joint()`
- `replace_lumber_piece()`
- `clone_subgraph()`
- `rotate_assembly()`
- `mirror_assembly()`
- `optimize_assembly_order()`
- `consolidate_joints()`
- `find_critical_pieces()`
- `calculate_load_paths()`
- `find_assembly_sequences()`
- `calculate_material_usage()`
- `to_dict()`/`from_dict()`
- `calculate_checksum()`
- `validate_assembly_dependencies()`

These tests follow TDD principles and are ready for when these features are implemented.

## Performance Results

Example performance metrics from tests:
- Node addition: < 0.1ms per node
- Edge addition: < 0.1ms per edge
- Pathfinding (100 nodes): < 10ms
- Component detection (1000 nodes): < 50ms
- Large assembly creation (1000 pieces): < 1 second

## Next Steps

1. Implement the missing methods to make all tests pass
2. Add more edge case tests as bugs are discovered
3. Consider adding integration tests with actual 3D rendering
4. Add tests for concurrent modifications (if needed)
5. Performance optimization based on benchmark results
